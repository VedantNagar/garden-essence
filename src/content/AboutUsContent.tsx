    "The need for fresh vegetables, grown without using any pesticides, has been felt worldwide and its demand is increasing gradually- especially after the pandemic. For the sake of my health and health of my dear ones, I also got built a polyhouse and installed Hydroponics’ setup (NFT, Kratky and Grow Bags) on my moderately big terrace in Delhi and started growing the veggies myself. But in next one year I realized that the Hydroponics’ Nutrients, which are easily available online, didn’t do the justice to the efforts and labour I was putting in growing these, so I decided to study about the requirements of the plants during their various stages of growth. I concentrated on both the Macro and Micro nutrients’ requirement of all household plants (my husband’s Chemistry background proved to be a boon for this).",
    "After research of about one year and after a few not-so-good results, we formulated a Hydroponics Nutrients Recipe and put it to test. Extensive trials were done for a variety of crops for another one and a half year in our polyhouse. The results were consistently astonishing and we decided to go commercial with our highly result-oriented, affordable Hydroponic Nutrients Recipes by name GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS and give all the interested Home Growers, Hobby Gardeners and Professional Hydroponics Growers a chance to experience the amazing results of our GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS. ",
    "The balance of Macro Nutrients - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, Magnesium, Calcium and Micro Nutrients – Iron, Manganese, Zinc, Boron, Copper and Molybdenum has been maintained in all our GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS recipes. It promotes vigorous vegetative growth. The carefully formulated blend of nutrients stimulates the development of strong roots, lush foliage, sturdy stems and robust fruiting. No supplementary feeding of these nutrients is required with GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS as it is complete and balanced solution of required plant food. GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS, at full strength (10 ml per 1 litre of RO water), gives an effective EC of around 2.1 μS/cm– EFFECTIVE EC IS THE EC OF PREPARED NUTRIENT SOLUTION MINUS THE INITIAL EC OF YOUR WATER. This translates to around 1050 ppm on a ppm500 scale.",
    "Another notable advantage of using GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS is its ease of use as it is made of 100% water soluble salts and the stock solution dissolves quickly and completely in water, ensuring that plants can readily absorb the essential elements. The clear instructions provided with the product make it simple for beginners to mix and apply the solution accurately. Additionally, the concentrated formula means that a little goes a long way, offering excellent value for money.",
    "GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS are prepared using chelated forms of most of the micronutrients.",
