    "The need for fresh vegetables, grown without using any pesticides, has been felt worldwide and its demand is increasing gradually- especially after the pandemic. For the sake of my health and health of my dear ones, I also got built a polyhouse and installed Hydroponics’ setup (NFT, Kratky and Grow Bags) on my moderately big terrace in Delhi and started growing the veggies myself. But in next one year I realized that the Hydroponics’ Nutrients, which are easily available online, didn’t do the justice to the efforts and labour I was putting in growing these, so I decided to study about the requirements of the plants during their various stages of growth. I concentrated on both the Macro and Micro nutrients’ requirement of all household plants (my husband’s Chemistry background proved to be a boon for this).",
    "After research of about one year and after a few not-so-good results, we formulated a Hydroponics Nutrients Recipe and put it to test. Extensive trials were done for a variety of crops for another one and a half year in our polyhouse. The results were consistently astonishing and we decided to go commercial with our highly result-oriented, affordable Hydroponic Nutrients Recipes by name GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS and give all the interested Home Growers, Hobby Gardeners and Professional Hydroponics Growers a chance to experience the amazing results of our GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS. ",
    "The balance of Macro Nutrients - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, Magnesium, Calcium and Micro Nutrients – Iron, Manganese, Zinc, Boron, Copper and Molybdenum has been maintained in all our GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS recipes. It promotes vigorous vegetative growth. The carefully formulated blend of nutrients stimulates the development of strong roots, lush foliage, sturdy stems and robust fruiting. No supplementary feeding of these nutrients is required with GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS as it is complete and balanced solution of required plant food. GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS, at full strength (10 ml per 1 litre of RO water), gives an effective EC of around 2.1 μS/cm– EFFECTIVE EC IS THE EC OF PREPARED NUTRIENT SOLUTION MINUS THE INITIAL EC OF YOUR WATER. This translates to around 1050 ppm on a ppm500 scale.",
    "Another notable advantage of using GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS is its ease of use as it is made of 100% water soluble salts and the stock solution dissolves quickly and completely in water, ensuring that plants can readily absorb the essential elements. The clear instructions provided with the product make it simple for beginners to mix and apply the solution accurately. Additionally, the concentrated formula means that a little goes a long way, offering excellent value for money.",
    "GARDEN ESSENCE™ PREMIUM HYDROPONICS NUTRIENTS are prepared using chelated forms of most of the micronutrients.",

  paragraphs: [
    "Simply put, hydroponics is a system of growing plants in water and in which direct feeding of plants is done and not of the soil or any other substrate i.e. the nutrients are dissolved in water and are immediately available to the plants through their roots. Therefore, it is necessary to use complete nutrients and not supplement fertilizers.",
    
    "We, at Garden Essence are dedicated and committed to provide the growers, both home and commercial, a complete package for your plants and not just supplement fertilizers. Our hydroponic nutrients contain all elements necessary for plant growth and in proper ratio to each other. Composition of the Garden Essence™ Premium Hydroponic Nutrients has been kept in a particular balance to satisfy the plants’ requirements for essential elements. This balance of all major and micro elements ensures that there is neither deficiency nor toxicity of any of these in the plants. As it is commonly known that the quality of ingredients determines the quality of end product, we use premium quality ingredients/salts in manufacturing our hydroponic nutrients.",
    
    "To keep plants in their comfort zone, you have to provide adequate amount of essential nutrients,manage the water temperature and ambient temperature, monitor relative humidity, adjust lighting and aeration of the nutrient solution.",

    "The saying - excess of anything is bad- which in hydroponics (and in general farming too) translates to “if a plant responds favourably to a certain dose of nutrients, then giving more dosage of the same will lead to toxicity and finally death of the plant”. Therefore, we have provided detailed dosage plan/chart of our Garden Essence™ Premium Hydroponic Nutrients in the instruction leaflet provided inside the box.",

    "With Garden Essence Premium Hydroponic Nutrients, the possibility of SALT IMBALANCE is ZERO as each ingredient/salt of Garden Essence™ Premium Hydroponic Nutrients is weighed individually, before adding in individual bottles.",

    "Garden Essence™ Premium Hydroponic Nutrients is a clean and 100% water-soluble product that will not clog spray lines, drip emitters and can be used in reservoirs."

  title: "Important Question",
  paragraphs: [
    "1. Different scales for TDS readings are being used around the world. Widely used ppm scales in hydroponics are the ppm500 scale, ppm650 scale and the ppm700 scale. The ppm500 scale is also referred to as TDS - total dissolved solids. The true ppm of a solution can only be determined by a chemical analysis, ppm cannot be measured by an EC meter. ppm Meter measure the EC of the solution and then convert it to a ppm reading as per the above-mentioned scales. If you are sure about the scale of your TDS meter and also if the requiredTDS is of the matching scale, then you can go ahead with the TDS meter and, if not, it is better to use the ECreadings, which is international scale used for measuring Electrical Conductivity (EC).",
    "2. Ideally, in closed hydroponics systems (like NFT, DWC, Kratky, ebb and flow systems, etc.) theprepared nutrient solution, should be completely replaced with fresh nutrient solution once every 12-15 days,as after such time the readings shown in your EC/TDS meter doesn’t reflect the actual nutrient content of thesolution. These readings may be erroneous with respect to certain elemental EC/ppm as the roots also exudesome organic matter in to the nutrient solution. If you intend to keep on recirculating the same nutrientsolution into your closed hydroponics system, it is advisable to get it tested regularly by any analytical laboratory. But this again is very costly proposition. The used/ spent nutrient solution can be used in your outdoor flower or vegetable garden."
